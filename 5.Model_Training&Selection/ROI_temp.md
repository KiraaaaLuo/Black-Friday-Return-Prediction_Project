## Model Performance:

- Accuracy of the model: Let's assume your model has an accuracy of 85%, meaning it correctly predicts whether an item will be purchased or returned 85% of the time.

## Transaction Volume:

- Let's assume you have a total of 500,000 transactions on Black Friday.

## Business Impact:

- Assume that the cost of misclassifying a purchase as a return or vice versa is significant and avoiding these errors will have a positive impact on revenue.

## Cost of Model Implementation:

- Assume the cost of implementing and maintaining the model for Black Friday is $50,000.

## Increased Revenue:

- Assuming a conservative estimate that the model helps in preventing 5% of potential returns.

Now, let's calculate the ROI:

- **Transaction Volume:** 500,000 transactions
- **Model Accuracy:** 85%
- **Potential Returns without Model:** 500,000 * (1 - Accuracy) = 500,000 * 0.15 = 75,000
- **Potential Returns Avoided with Model:** 75,000 * 5% = 3,750
- **Assumed Revenue per Transaction:** $100 (this can vary based on your actual average transaction value)
- **Total Increased Revenue:** 3,750 * $100 = $375,000

## ROI Calculation:

\[ \text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Total Increased Revenue} - \text{Cost of Model Implementation}}{\text{Cost of Model Implementation}} \]

\[ \text{ROI} = \frac{\$375,000 - \$50,000}{\$50,000} \]

\[ \text{ROI} = 6.5 \]
